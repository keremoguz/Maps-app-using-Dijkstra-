# Maps-app-using-Dijkstra-

## Explanation:
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a given source node to every other node. It can also be used to find the shortest path to a specific destination node, by terminating the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node is known. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities, and the costs of edges represent the average distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, then Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities.

## Input Format
There are two required input files:

city_connections.txt:

Each line represents a connection between two cities.
Format: CityA, CityB 
Example:
CityA, CityB 
CityA, CityC
CityB, CityD
city_coordinates.txt:

Each line contains the city name and its coordinates.
Format: CityName, XCoord, YCoord
Example:
CityA, 34, 45
CityB, 50, 78
CityC, 23, 56

## Programming Language
Java is used as the programming language
